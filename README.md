Kinect-Driven Animata digital puppetry

A Project by Brittany Stodgell Alan Chatham 2013

Like 001, This project uses the KinectOSC project and Animata to drive 2-d animations in real-time using 1 or 2 kinects. It uses the official Kinect SDK (v1.7) instead of OpenNI, so it tracks skeletons easily with no calibration.

You'll need to download the official Microsoft Kinect SDK for this to work, and of course, this only works on Windows.
